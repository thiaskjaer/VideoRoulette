Pseudorandomly play a video file from one of many subdirectories and keep a tally of the files picked

I wanted to watch random episodes of TV shows. I made this script to pick a random episode given multiple folders (seasons). Out of mild interest it also keeps a tally to see how many times any episode was picked.
